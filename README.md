# ADTs-cplusplus
Abstract data types commonly used in Adam's courses.  In building these data structures, I borrowed ideas discussed by [Timothy Budd](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~budd/), [Cliff Schaffer](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/), [Mark Weiss](http://users.cs.fiu.edu/~weiss/), past students (they tend to have lots of good ideas), and myself.
